const vs. let
--------------
- use const by default
- use let when rebinding / mutating is needed.
- same named let-vars in another scope are different variables!



arrow functions
----------------
- arriÃ´ws are always anonymous functions
- only on parameter, no bracket is needed
- implicit return (no {}, & 'return' word) on onliners:
    const fullNames3 = names.map(name => `${name} adamski`);
- arrow function inheritance 'this' from parent functions
- use regular functions if you want to refer this to a dom-node
- when NOT to use it:
    - if you really need THIS
    - when you neeed a method to miend to an object
